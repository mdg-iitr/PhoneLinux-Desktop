# WORK IN PROGRESS
Basic idealogy:
The requests to server from client would contain a command in 'one' field of protobuf that is updated in the database and returned. If 'one' field is empty it would simply return last 5 commands from database. A sample client is provided in client.py

# Files structure:
remoteFunctions.py contains remote functions to be called.
server.py is server file
comProto defines protocol buffer
comProto_pb2.py and comProto_pb2_grpc.py are autogenerated files.

1. To run the server, make .env file in proto folder. Fields are given in env_sample. Install requirements from requirements.txt
2. In one terminal
$ python3 server.py
3. In other terminal
$ python3 client.py
